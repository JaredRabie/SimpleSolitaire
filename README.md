# SimpleSolitaire

The aim of this project is to develop an alternative version of Solitaire for my CompSci 130 final assignment. The assignment comes in two parts: main.py which is a base version of the game with only one suit, and main_ext.py which is a custom extension of the base game which introduces custom suits, card ranges, and pile numbers to create a variety of difficulties.

Current Features:
 - Easy, Medium, Hard and Legendary difficulties.
 - Custom difficulty with player-determined suits, card ranges, and pile numbers.
 - Limited move counter which introduces a second loss condition.

What I have learned:
 - In-depth understanding of classes, including taking advantage of operator overloading to keep code simple, readable, and maintainable. 
 - Working with the Stack data type.
 - Using error handling to ensure data taken from user is valid
